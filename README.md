# Westmed Provider Search Engine

## Purpose
The Westmed Provider Search Engine is designed to assist call center agents in quickly and efficiently looking up information regarding healthcare providers in our network.

## Components
The webpage consists of two main sections:

### 1. Search Form
The top half of the page features a search form that allows agents to specify the desired characteristics of a provider. Agents can input various criteria to filter the search results based on their needs.

### 2. Search Results
The bottom half of the page displays the search results, with each provider meeting the input criteria appearing in a separate Provider Card. 

## Provider Card
The Provider Card includes essential information about the provider:

- Gender
- Full Name
- Title
- Specialty
- Common Visit Reasons
- Offices and their addresses
- Fax numbers for each office location

Additionally, the Provider Card contains a set of Badge Icons at the top-right corner to quickly convey extra information about the provider, such as:

- Acceptance of new patients
- Provider's leave status
- Acceptance of Worker's Comp
- Provider's Departure

Lastly, if there is crucial information that the agent must be aware of regarding a specific provider, an "Important Information" section will appear in red text to ensure visibility and attention.

## Excel Sheet Upload Feature
The search engine enables users to upload provider information to the database using an Excel Sheet. This feature simplifies the process of adding new providers or updating existing information and ensures the database remains accurate and up-to-date.

In conclusion, the Westmed Provider Search Engine serves as a powerful tool for call center agents, streamlining the process of locating and sharing provider information with clients. By implementing this search engine, our company demonstrates its commitment to providing exceptional customer service and enhancing the overall client experience. The ease of use and comprehensiveness of the search engine ensure that our agents have the most accurate and up-to-date information at their fingertips, empowering them to deliver the best possible support to our valued customers.
